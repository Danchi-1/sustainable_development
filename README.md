SDG Air Quality Prediction Project
Introduction
This project aims to predict air quality and its impact on respiratory health using machine learning, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By analyzing pollution data, we can help reduce deaths and illnesses from air pollution, promote sustainable cities, and ensure environmental justice.
Project Overview
The project consists of five main components:
    1. Data Preprocessing: Fetches and preprocesses air quality data from OpenAQ API or synthetic data.
    2. Machine Learning Models: Implements various algorithms to predict air quality.
    3. Data Analysis: Performs exploratory data analysis and visualizations to understand pollution patterns and health impacts.
    4. Ethics and SDG Integration: Analyzes model fairness, bias, and alignment with SDGs.
    5. Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance and generates comprehensive reports.
Features
    • Predicts air quality using machine learning models.
    • Analyzes health impacts of air pollution.
    • Ensures model fairness and ethical considerations.
    • Provides visualizations and reports for better understanding and communication of results.
Technologies Used
    • Programming Language: Python
    • Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    • APIs: OpenAQ API for air quality data
Getting Started
Prerequisites
    • Python 3.6 or higher
    • Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts
Setup
    1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sdg-air-quality-prediction.git
cd sdg-air-quality-prediction
    2. Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
    3. Set Up Environment (recommended):
bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Usage
    1. Data Preprocessing:
bash
Copy
python data_preprocessing.py
This will fetch and preprocess the air quality data, saving it to data/processed/air_quality_processed.csv.
    2. Train Machine Learning Models:
bash
Copy
python ml_models.py
This will train multiple models and save the best model for further use.
    3. Data Analysis:
bash
Copy
python data_analysis.py
This will perform exploratory data analysis and generate visualizations.
    4. Ethics and SDG Integration Analysis:
bash
Copy
python ethics_sdg_integration.py
This will analyze model fairness and generate an ethics report.
    5. Model Evaluation:
bash
Copy
python model_evaluation.py
This will evaluate the model's performance and generate an evaluation report.

Customization
You can customize this project by:
    • Using your own dataset by placing it in data/raw/ and modifying the data preprocessing script.
    • Adjusting model parameters in ml_models.py to experiment with different configurations.
    • Modifying the analysis and visualization scripts to focus on different aspects of the data.
Ethical Considerations and SDG Alignment
This project is designed with ethics and SDG alignment in mind:
    • Ensures model fairness across different demographic groups
    • Promotes environmental justice by identifying pollution disparities
    • Supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)
